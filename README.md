### Hi ThereðŸ‘‹,
 Hello! My name is Anold Iâ€™m a full-stack development student currently enrolled in a remote development school that uses pair programming and real-world projects to teach development.
 "I'm currently completing coursework at Microverse, a remote software development that allows devs from all over the world to pair-program and build projects together. I've spent the last several months completely immersed in remote development, building everything from landing pages to Rails APIs."
